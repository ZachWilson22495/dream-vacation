  <h1>My House</h1></div>
  
  <h5>Everything you could ever want!</h5>
  <p>When it comes to the perfect place to take a couple days off of work and disappear, there's nowhere I'd rather go than my own house.
    From here, I can enjoy the bustle of city life from a comfortable distance. Entertainment possibilities are endless thanks to the powers
    of electricity and creativity (electricity and creativity come separate from vacation package.)
    Have delicious local cuisine delivered to your front door. Get up close and personal with the native fauna. Or go for a refreshing swim in the 60" x 32" swimming pool.
    By the end of my vacation, I always feel refreshed and ready to return home.
